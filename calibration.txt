# example calibration file for pulsemagstep

# Format: <voltage (V)> <field (mT)>
# Separator: one space
# Lines beginning with # and blank lines are ignored.

# Note that this is not a real, or realistic, calibration:
# it contains deliberate deviations from linearity designed to
# show more clearly the effects of different interpolation methods.
